				<div class="equipTextLeft">
					<h2 class="h2Equip">1. A tank</h2>
					<h3 class="h3Equip">20$-150$</h3>
					<p class="pLeft">The dimensions are up to you. I chose the small ones because I do not have much space in my bedroom, and also because of my budget. Also, I find small saltwater aquariums more charming, for some reason. But the smaller the tank is, the harder to maintain, because the problems spread quicker and in stronger concentration!</p>

				<div class="equipTextRight">
					<h2 class="h2Equip">2. A stand for your aquarium</h2>
					<h3 class="h3Equip">30$-80$</h3>
					<p class="pRight">It can be on a desk, if it is a very small one, but keep it mind the aquarium is going to be really heavy with all the water in it. The tank often comes with a stand that is made to support its weight.</p>

			<div class="divEquip">
				<img src="../img/equipment3.svg" class="imgRight" alt="light illustration">
				<div class="equipTextLeft">
					<h2 class="h2Equip">3. Lightning</h2>
					<h3 class="h3Equip">60$-250$</h3>
					<p class="pLeft">Lighting is really important for reef aquariums, especially if you plan to add corals in it. A mix of blue and white light is perfect for the coral to grow. I strongly recommend buying a good one, even if you have a tight budget, since it is going to benefit in the long run.</p>

				<div class="equipTextRight">
					<h2 class="h2Equip">4. Protein skimmer and filtration system</h2>
					<h3 class="h3Equip">100$-250$</h3>
					<p class="pRight">The protein skimmer is important in a saltwater tank. It will deal with the dissolved organic compounds out of the aquarium. You can also take a biological filter to deal with these wastes, but I prefer having a good protein skimmer dealing with this and also have a filter that works for the 3 types of filtration (mechanical, biological and chemical) to keep the water clean.</p>

			<div class="divEquip">
				<img src="../img/equipment5.svg" class="imgRight" alt="tank illustration">
				<div class="equipTextLeft">
					<h2 class="h2Equip">5. Powerhead(s). </h2>
					<h3 class="h3Equip">40$-80$</h3>
					<p class="pLeft">This is the main equipment that will create current in your tank. The bigger the tank is, the more powerful they need to be. It is best to have the ones that make random movement, to simulate a real flow, but they cost more, and for what I have experienced I am doing just fine with my fixed powerheads.</p>

			<div class="divEquip">
				<img src="../img/equipment6.svg" class="imgLeft" alt="tank illustration">
				<div class="equipTextRight">
					<h2 class="h2Equip">6. Liverock and sand</h2>
					<h3 class="h3Equip">10$-20$ per gallon</h3>
					<p class="pRight">These are not only an aesthetic choice for your tank. It helps the fishes and other organisms to establish their territory, and to hide from time to time. They also act like a biological filter for the water. Another thing about liverocks is that it helps the nitrogen cycle to complete (a cycle that always happens in a new tank). You need about one pound of rocks per gallon of water, which becomes quickly expensive with bigger tanks.</p>

				<img src="../img/equipment7.svg" class="imgRight" alt="tank illustration">
				<div class="equipTextLeft">
					<h2 class="h2Equip">7. Heater</h2>
					<h3 class="h3Equip">30$-60$</h3>
					<p class="pLeft">A heater helps keeping the temperature at the same level the water would have in the ocean. This is for small tanks. If you have a tank that has lights that produces a lot of heat, you may need the opposite (something to cool off your water temperature). In both cases, the temperature of the tank should always be around 78 ºF.</p>

				<img src="../img/equipment8.svg" class="imgLeft" alt="tank illustration">
				<div class="equipTextRight">
					<h2 class="h2Equip">8. Test kits, salt, and different products</h2>
					<h3 class="h3Equip">Price will depend on many factors.</h3>
					<p class="pRight">You need to always take your parameters in your tank so you can react quickly if something starts to be wrong. There are a lot of  “test kits” on the market, which includes all the different products to make tests for your tank. If something goes wrong, you need to put the good product to put the parameters numbers back in place. you will also obviously need salt to make salty water for your reef. The good ratio of salt per gallon is approximately 1.026. Finally, sometimes there will be a problem with the tank, and you will need specific products to deal with them. The price for all of this will depend on how big the tank is and how healthy it is.</p>

				<div class="equipTextLeft">
					<h2 class="h2Equip">9. Osmosis water</h2>
					<h3 class="h3Equip">3$-7$ per 5 gallons</h3>
					<p class="pLeft">Tap water contains undesirable stuff in it. Osmosis water is needed to make sure the water is chemical free. You can find some in every specialized reef stores. </p>
